I have made a quiz generator app for my project. This project, a voice quiz generator App has an educational theme. I chose this project because I feel it is both relevant to present uses of A.I. and helps in understanding the basic code and general applications of Speech Synthesis software.
A quiz generator app can be used by schools and educational institutions to monitor their students’ progress and promote interest in learning by facilitating the testing process. The app can also function as and additional learning facility which tests and provides feedback on the learnings of a student. This would aid in increasing the growth of students and in general help in education.
This specific app is designed to aid people who can’t see vey well and find it difficult to differentiate and recognize text and buttons. The app has options to read out the questions and the choices, it reads out the result at the end and also reads out the option the user has selected to confirm the choice.
Features
The app’s main feature is asking the user questions from a quiz.
It reads out the option that the user has selected
It checks the user’s answers with the correct answers with which it has been provided.
At the end of the quiz it provides the user with results and the correct answers.
It also provides feedback depending on performance![image](https://github.com/Eishani/Quiztones/assets/136086864/331a7a96-4e83-40c5-8d9e-7ac38541c4d7)
